# Can Sum

Write a function, provided a list of integer numbers and another target number, 
that returns a boolean indicating whether-or-not it is possible to generate
the target number using numbers from the array.

- You may use an element of the array as many times as needed.
- You may assume all the input numbers are non-negative.

## Example

Input: `numbers = [5, 3, 4, 7], target = 7` <br />
Output: `true`

Input: `numbers = [5, 4], target = 7` <br />
Output: `false`


# Best Sum

Write a function, provided a list of integer numbers and another target number,
returns an array of numbers containing the shortest combination of numbers that
add up to exactly the target. If there is any tie for shortest combination, you
may return any one of the shortest.

## Example

Input: `numbers = [5, 3, 4, 7], target = 7` <br />
Output: `[7]`

Input: `numbers = [2, 3, 5], target = 8` <br />
Output: `[3 ,5]`

Input: `numbers = [5, 4], target = 7` <br />
Output: `null`



# How Sum

Write a function, provided a list of integer numbers and another target number,
that returns an array containing any combination of elements that add up to
exactly the target. If there is no combination that adds up to the target,
then return null.

- If there are multiple combinations possible, return any single one.


## Example

Input: `numbers = [5, 3, 4, 7], target = 7` <br />
Output: `[3,4] or [7] or [4,3]`

Input: `numbers = [5, 4], target = 7` <br />
Output: `null `
