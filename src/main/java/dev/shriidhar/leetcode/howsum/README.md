# How Sum

Write a function, provided a list of integer numbers and another target number,
that returns an array containing any combination of elements that add up to 
exactly the target. If there is no combination that adds up to the target, 
then return null.

- If there are multiple combinations possible, return any single one.


## Example

Input: `numbers = [5, 3, 4, 7], target = 7` <br />
Output: `[3,4] or [7] or [4,3]`

Input: `numbers = [5, 4], target = 7` <br />
Output: `null`
