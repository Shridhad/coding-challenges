# Best Sum

Write a function, provided a list of integer numbers and another target number,
returns an array of numbers containing the shortest combination of numbers that 
add up to exactly the target. If there is any tie for shortest combination, you 
may return any one of the shortest. 

## Example

Input: `numbers = [5, 3, 4, 7], target = 7` <br />
Output: `[7]`

Input: `numbers = [2, 3, 5], target = 8` <br />
Output: `[3 ,5]`

Input: `numbers = [5, 4], target = 7` <br />
Output: `null`
