## Grid Traveler

You are a traveler on a two-dimensional grid. You begin in the top-left corner and your goal is
to travel the bottom-right corner. You may only move down or right. You can not move left or up, 
definitely not move diagonally.  

> Question: In how many ways can you travel to the goal on grid with dimensions `m * n`? 


### Examples

Input: `m=1, n=1` <br />
Output: `1`

Input: `m=2, n=3` <br />
Output: `3`
