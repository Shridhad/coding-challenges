## Can Construct

Provided a target string and dictionary of words, derive whether-or-not the target 
string can be constructed by concatenating words of the dictionary. 

- You may use elements of dictionary as many times as needed.

### Example: 

Input: `words=[ab, abc, cd, def, abcd]; target=abcded` <br />
Output: `true`

Input: `words=[bo, rd, ate, sk, t, ska, boar]; target=skateboard` <br />
Output: `false`
