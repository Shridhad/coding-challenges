# Can Sum

Write a function, provided a list of integer numbers and another target number, 
that returns a boolean indicating whether-or-not it is possible to generate
the target number using numbers from the array.

- You may use an element of the array as many times as needed.
- You may assume all the input numbers are non-negative.

## Example

Input: `numbers = [5, 3, 4, 7], target = 7` <br />
Output: `true`

Input: `numbers = [5, 4], target = 7` <br />
Output: `false`
